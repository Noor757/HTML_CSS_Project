<h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Early life and Education </h2>
<p style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Park Jimin was born on October 13, 1995, in Geumjeong District, Busan, South Korea. His family consists of his mother, father and younger brother.

     During middle school, he &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;attended Just Dance Academy and learned popping and locking dance.  Jimin studied contemporary dance at Busan High School of Arts and was a top student in the modern dance &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;department. After a teacher suggested he audition with an entertainment company, it led him to Big Hit Entertainment. Once he passed the auditions in 2012, he transferred to &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Korean Arts High School, graduating in 2014. Now he is enrolled at  Hanyang Cyber University, pursuing a Master of Business Administration in Advertising and Media.</p>
